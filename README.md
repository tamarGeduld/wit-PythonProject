# 🛡️ CodeGuard – Code Analysis System for `wit push`


---

## 🎯 Overview

CodeGuard is a backend system designed to automatically analyze Python code every time the user runs the `wit push` command. It acts as a lightweight Continuous Integration (CI) tool focused on code quality by detecting common issues in code and providing visual insights through graphs. 

The system uses Python's **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** to inspect code, identifies issues such as long functions, unused variables, missing docstrings, and large files, and then generates informative graphs with **Matplotlib** to help developers maintain clean and efficient code. 

Now includes support for **MongoDB** to track historical analysis results over time and generate trends.

## 🚀 Installation and Execution

### 📋 Prerequisites

> Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** installed.

### 📦 Required Packages

Install the necessary Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart matplotlib requests pymongo
```

### ▶️ Running the Server

Start the FastAPI server with:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

## 🔌 API Endpoints

| 🎯 Endpoint | 📡 Method | 📝 Description |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| `/analyze` | `POST` | Accepts Python files and returns code analysis graphs as images. |
| `/alert` | `POST` | Accepts Python files and returns JSON warnings for code issues detected. |
| `/graph/image` | `GET` | Returns a specific image (PNG) of a generated graph by file path query. |

---

## ✅ Code Quality Checks

The server performs the following checks on each pushed file:

- **📏 Function Length:** Warns if any function exceeds 20 lines.
- **📄 File Length:** Warns if the entire file exceeds 200 lines.
- **🔍 Unused Variables:** Warns if variables are assigned but never used.
- **📖 Missing Docstrings:** Warns if functions lack documentation strings.
- **🌟 Bonus:** Detects variables written in non-English letters and issues warnings.

---

## 📊 Visual Graphs Provided

- **📈 Histogram:** Distribution of function lengths across the codebase.
- **🥧 Pie Chart:** Breakdown of issues by type.
- **📊 Bar Chart:** Number of issues per file.
- **📉 Line Chart:** Number of total issues over time, powered by MongoDB.

---

## 🗄️ MongoDB Integration

CodeGuard now saves each analysis result to MongoDB when using the `/alert` endpoint. This allows tracking historical trends and generating time-based visualizations like the line chart. 

> **Note:** Make sure to configure MongoDB connection in `db.py`.
